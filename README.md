## Usage

After cloning the repository you should first install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

**Start development server**:

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app in action. Every change you make in the `src` directory will trigger a reload of your application.

**Create production build**:

```
npm run compile
```

The production build will be available in the `lib` directory.
